 You won’t get constant off-tracks; edge behavior is now safer. Training should converge to ~18.5–19.0s with 3h.

 The gentle-turn shaping is overly cautious → you’re capped at ~4.0 m/s in sections where you could carry ~4.2. This is the main thing holding you from the 17s target.

 Loosen GENTLE_CORNER_SPEED (from 4.1 → 4.2) and narrow the gentle band (reduce threshold from 4.5 → 3.8). That will reclassify more arcs as “straights” and let you push speed without wobble.
